Embarking on a culinary journey at Savoury, our beloved Thai restaurant nestled in Terminal 21, Bangkok, proved to be a symphony of flavors that left an indelible mark on our taste buds. Here's a glimpse into the gastronomic delights that made this dining experience truly exceptional.

Diving into our Thai feast, the Tom Yum Soup captivated us with its bold and spicy broth, setting the stage for the delightful array of dishes that followed. The Steamed Fish, perfectly cooked and infused with aromatic herbs, showcased the restaurant's commitment to authenticity.

The Pineapple Rice, a fragrant medley of sweet and savory, brought a tropical touch to our meal, while the Mango Sticky Rice delivered the perfect balance of textures and sweetness for a satisfying dessert. The Coconut Cream Panna Cotta was a heavenly conclusion to the meal, a creamy and indulgent treat that left us craving for more.

To quench our thirst, the Coconut Milkshake proved to be a refreshing companion, perfectly complementing the richness of the dishes. The Stir-Fried Cabbage, a simple yet flavorful side, added a crunchy and wholesome element to our feast.
