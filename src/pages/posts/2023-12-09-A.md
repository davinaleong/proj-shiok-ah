Hey foodies, I've got a not-so-savory experience to share from my recent order via Grab, featuring McDonald's. 🍔🚗

I was craving those crispy hashbrowns, so when I saw the option for extra hashbrowns on the Grab app, I gladly ticked it for each of the three meals I ordered. Imagine my dismay when my order arrived, and guess what was missing? Yep, you guessed it - the extra hashbrowns! 💸😟

Now, I've lost a total of $9, and I'm left with a bit of frustration. If McDonald's isn't planning to hand out those golden potato delights, they really shouldn't tease us with the option on the app, right?

What's your take on this, fellow foodies? Let's hope for a crispy resolution to this hashbrown hassle. 🤞🍟 #GrabFail #McDonaldsDisappoints #HashbrownGate #FoodBloggersUnite
