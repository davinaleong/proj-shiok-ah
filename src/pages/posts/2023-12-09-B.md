During a recent visit to Peramakan at Paya Lebar Quarters (PLQ), Singapore, I observed a notable change in the dining experience. While the restaurant maintains its historical charm, it's essential to note that the standard has slightly dropped, and some dishes lack the authentic flavors they once possessed.

The culinary journey at Peramakan used to be synonymous with exceptional Peranakan flavors. However, on this occasion, I noticed a variance in taste, with certain dishes not quite capturing the essence they once did. This shift may be a concern for those who cherished the original authenticity of the restaurant.

Despite these observations, Peramakan remains a symbol of Peranakan heritage and still offers a dining experience with a touch of nostalgia. It's recommended to approach the visit with an awareness of the potential changes in flavor profiles. The restaurant's ambiance and historical significance remain intact, offering patrons a blend of tradition and contemporary dining.
